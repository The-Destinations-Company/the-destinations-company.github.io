Once routes and sign locations are determined, they are entered into a database. This database is the central store for all information such as individual signs, their location, type and messages. They are then referenced on floor plans. The fact that both plan and database need to be kept up to date manually when the other changes, makes prone to error and tedious.
 
Messages and their content change during development and existing designs need to be updated. In larger projects with a lot of signs this can be time consuming.
