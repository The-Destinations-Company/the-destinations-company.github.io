Once routes and sign locations are determined, they are entered into a database. This database is the central store for all information such as individual signs, their location, type and messages. They are then referenced on floor plans[^1]. The fact that both plan and database need to be kept up to date manually when the other changes, makes prone to error and tedious[^2].
 
Messages and their content change during development and existing designs need to be updated. In larger projects with a lot of signs this can be time consuming.
